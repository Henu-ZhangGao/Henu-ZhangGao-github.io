# Time and Space Complexity
Definition: time and space complexity are significant factors reflecting the efficiency of an algorithm.

1. Θ: the high bound and low bound of spending time => `f(x)=Θ(g(x))` `f(x)<=max(g(x)) and f(x)>=min(g(x)) `
2. O: the high bound of spending time =>`f(x)<=max(g(x))`
3. Ω: the low bound of spending time =>`f(x)>=min(g(x))`
4. o: the hight bound of spending time but not equal with the limit of => `f(x)<max(g(x))`
5. ω:the low bound of spending time but not equal with the limit of => `f(x)>min(g(x))`
